;;; Commentary:

;; This package provides an evil operator to cycle case formats in text objects:
;; - snake -> UPCASE -> CamelCase -> kebab
;; try using g~iw, g~io, g~iW. try repeating the operation with the `.` operator.

;;; Code:

(require 'evil)
(require 'string-inflection)

(defvar evil-string-inflection-func 'string-inflection-all-cycle-function
  "The function to use when calling the operator.")

(make-local-variable 'evil-string-inflection-func)

;;;###autoload
(autoload 'evil-string-inflection "evil-string-inflection.el"
  "Define a new evil operator that cicles underscore -> UPCASE -> CamelCase." t)

(evil-define-operator evil-operator-string-inflection (beg end _type)
  "Define a new evil operator that cicles underscore -> UPCASE -> CamelCase."
  :move-point nil
  (interactive "<R>")
  (let ((str (buffer-substring-no-properties beg end)))
    (save-excursion
      (delete-region beg end)
      (insert (funcall evil-string-inflection-func str)))))

(define-key evil-normal-state-map (kbd "g~") 'evil-operator-string-inflection)

(provide 'evil-string-inflection)
